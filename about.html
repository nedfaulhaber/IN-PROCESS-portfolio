        <h2>Ned Faulhaber: The Exclusive Interview</h2>
        <h4>(conducted by Ned Faulhaber)</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="qa-content">
        <p>Q: In 20 words or less, tell me everything about you.</p>
        <p>A: I'd be hard-pressed to do that.  I'm a truly extroverted guy - I love hearing people's stories and sharing mine.  Tell me a bit about yourself, and don't worry about the 20 words.</p>
        <p>Q: Turned the tables on me.  OK.  I grew up in Cleveland, went to IU Bloomington, and moved out here with friends thinking that we'd live in Portland, OR for a bit and then road trip over to Portland, ME and live there too.  20 years on, I haven't been to Portland, ME yet.  No plans to move from this incredible city.</p>
        <p>A: Hobbies?</p>
        <p>Q: Music, backpacking with my two daughters, hanging out on the Portland coffee scene, drinking craft beers, and trying Willamette Valley Pinot whenever possible.</p>
        <p>A: OK, this is getting confusing.  I'd better answer something to get you back in the interviewer seat.  Am I a musician?  You were surely going to ask.  Yes, I am a musician, like seemingly everyone in Portland.  In fact, I taught music at a local arts academy for adults with developmental disabilities for 6 years.</p>
        <p>Q: Instrument?</p>
        <p>A: Electric and upright bass.  Stylistically all over the place - from experimental electronic music to a Patsy Cline cover band.</p>
        <p>Q: Did you teach elsewhere?</p>
        <p>A: I taught Pop Culture for years up at Clark College in Vancouver.  Loved every minute of it (I lie - grading 5 page essays was not super fun).  One of my favorite parts of the class was getting students to admit that they all have a personal style, even if they wouldn't be first in line for McQueen fashions.</p>
        <p>Q: Pop culture? What are you watching right now?</p>
        <p>A: In the platinum era of TV, I am actually catching up on Buffy the Vampire Slayer instead.  It's platinum to me, anyway.</p>
        <p>Q: Why coding?</p>
        <p>A: Always need to be learning new things, and I have a love of computers.  Seemed like a natural thing to start playing around with. Turns out I loved it, so I went to Epicodus to get deep in and start the journey of constant challenge that this field provides.</p>
        <p>Q: What is the air speed velocity of an unladen swallow?</p>
        <p>A: African or European?</p>
        <p>Q: ... </p>
